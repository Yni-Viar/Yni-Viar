# Sideloading apps on Google Android after 2026-2027.
## TUTORIAL IS UNFINISHED, BECAUSE THERE ARE NO WORKING TRUSTED APPS, WHICH WORK WITH ADB.

Google recently announced, that **every Android app MUST be signed by Google**.

That means, you need to **provide personal ID, address and pay a fee(!) to Google just for creating (for example an open-source) app!**

What about homeless? What about someone, who does not want personal information leak (which may or may not lead to dangerous things, such as stalking)?

## Requirements

- Wi-Fi connection.
