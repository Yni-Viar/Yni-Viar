- 👋 Hello, I’m Yni
- 👀 I’m interested in SCP Foundation Community.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on free and open-source projects (maybe proprietary, but please, read p.😒).
- 😒 I don’t like collaborating in proprietary projects (except my own projects), because of possible copyright problems in my FOSS projects.
- 🌱 I partially know C#, Python/GDScript and Godot Engine.
- 🌱 I plan to learn C++.
