- 👋 Hello, I’m Yni
- 👀 I’m interested in gamedev.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on free and open-source projects (maybe proprietary, but please, read p.😒).
- 🔒 I can collaborate in proprietary/paid games/projects, but I'd like to continue my own projects WITHOUT any copyright violations.
- 🌱 I know C# (1 year of practice), Python (recently learned), Godot Engine/GDScript (2.5 years of practice), C++ (recently learned).
<!-- - 🌱 I am learning C, C++, Unreal Engine 5.-->
