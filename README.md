- 👋 Hello, I’m Yni
- 👀 I’m interested in gamedev.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on free and open-source projects (maybe proprietary, but please, read p.😒).
- 😒 I can collaborate in proprietary/paid games/projects, but I'd like to continue my own projects WITHOUT any copyright violations.
- 🌱 I know C# (1 year of practice), Python (recently learned), Godot Engine/GDScript (2 years of practice).
- 🌱 I plan to learn C, C++, Unreal Engine 5.
